# KEBI-Project

## Problem Description

Many restaurants have their menus digitized. Guests can scan a QR code and have the 
menu presented on their smartphones. A disadvantage is that the screen is very small and it 
is difficult to get an overview, in particular, if the menu is large. However, some guests can 
not or do not want every meal, e.g. vegetarians or guests with an allergy. Instead of showing 
all the meals that are offered, it would be preferable to show only those meals the guest 
prefers. 
The objective of the project is to represent the knowledge about meals and guest 
preferences and create a system that allows to select those meals that fit the guest 
preferences.  
The knowledge base shall contain information about typical meals of an Italian restaurant, 
e.g. pizza, pasta, and main dishes. Meals consist of ingredients. There are different types of 
ingredients like meat, vegetables, fruits, or dairy. For each ingredient, there is information 
about the calories.  
Guests can be carnivores, vegetarians, calorie-conscious, or suffer from allergies, e.g. 
lactose or gluten intolerance.
